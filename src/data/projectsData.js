    projectName: "Overwatch Companion",
    projectDescription:
      "For my first crack at Next.js, I dove into the world of Overwatch 2, a game I'm pretty hooked on during my downtime. The result? A fun little app with an Overwatch vibe, meant to be a cool companion for fellow gamers. It grabs data from APIs to give you the lowdown on characters and real players. Plus, there's a community section for chatting and bonding over games. It was a blast blending my gaming passion with some web dev skills, and it's definitely a highlight in my portfolio.",

    projectName: "Social Media App",
    projectDescription:
      "So, I'd dabbled in creating a social media app before, using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. But diving into React for the second round was a refreshing challenge. Implementing features like comments under posts and the ability to search for gifs to add to comments/posts was genuinely satisfying. I revisited this concept later on, incorporating user authentication into projects like Flavor.Voyage and another social media app you can find on my GitHub.",

    projectDescription:
      "I revisited a cookie clicker game I had created a few weeks earlier using vanilla JavaScript, but this time, I opted for React. The aim of this project was to showcase how React could simplify the development process. The difference was quite strikingâ€”I found React allowed for a smoother and faster development experience compared to vanilla JS.",
